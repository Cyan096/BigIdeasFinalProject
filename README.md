Alex Myrick's Dataset: 
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death
I used the csv (by neighborhood) contained in this dataset to make inferences about the best neighborhood in Allegheny County/Pittsburgh by comparing the median age of death of each neighborhood with the other data points and with the given neighborhood's total death count. I did not incorporate bias into my inferences, and as such I did not deal with the other columns of the dataset that deal with race or make assumptions about the distribution of the populations with regards to overall age.
