Alex Myrick's Dataset: 
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death
I used the csv (by neighborhood) contained in this dataset to make inferences about the best neighborhood in Allegheny County/Pittsburgh by comparing the median age of death of each neighborhood with the other data points and with the given neighborhood's total death count. I did not incorporate bias into my inferences, and as such I did not deal with the other columns of the dataset that deal with race or make assumptions about the distribution of the populations with regards to overall age. 

Gavin Frankenberg's Dataset:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-public-schools-enrollment/resource/7b0660d1-c812-496d-ab0a-8560902e9e70
I used the Enrollment 2020-21 by School and Neighborhood to draw conclusions on the quality of neighborhoods through their respective enrolled student counts. I chose not to incorporate the specific schools of the dataset, opting instead to sum the schools enroll counts in the same neighborhood as that would give a more broad representation of the neighborhood. No factors such as race or gender were present in the dataset and therefore were not present in my analysis.
